The pyvisa API changed significantly around version 1.5 and 1.6, this
means that old drivers may not work out-of-the-box.  Fortunately, the
changes that concern most drivers are minor:

1) Units for the 'timeout' parameter changed from seconds to
   MILLISECONDS!!! (Not a problem if the instrument driver doesn't
   specify a timeout.)

2) The syntax for creating instruments changed, i.e., need to replace
   "visa.instrument(address, timeout=2, term_chars='\n')" with:
   
      self._visainstrument = visa.ResourceManager().open_resource(address, timeout=2000)
      self._visainstrument.read_termination = '\n'
      self._visainstrument.write_termination = '\n'

3) Ascii and binary data are now treated differently. If you need to
   deal with non-ASCII data, you may need to use read_raw() and/or
   write_raw() instead of just read() and write().

4) Termination characters (\r,\n) are no longer automatically stripped if
   you don't manually specify the read_termination.


See the notes on the pyvisa website for more details:

Note: the old drivers should warn about this change as they were changed by running:
find instrument_plugins -name '*.py' -type f -exec sed -i -r 's~^(\s*)(.+?=\s*visa\.instrument\s*.+)$~#>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\1assert False, "pyvisa syntax has changed, tweak the line below according to the instructions in qtlab/instrument_plugins/README_PYVISA_API_CHANGES"\n\1#\2\n#<<<<<<<<<<<<<<~' {} \;
