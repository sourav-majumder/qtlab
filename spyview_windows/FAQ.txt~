Loading files
=============

There are a couple of options:

- specify filenames on the command line (for nerds)

- load files using the "Load..." button

- Drag and drop files onto the spyview control window: this will add
  them to the file list.


Postscript Preview command
==========================

It should now work by default, as long as you have gsview installed on
the c: drive.

If it does not work, check the preview command under the postscript
controls: it should be set to:

start /min preview.bat "%s"

If it is not, reset it to this value and save to the default settings
by using the "Save Settings" button in the spyview controls window and
selecting "default.svs".

If gsview32.exe is installed in a non-standard location, just edit
preview.bat to put point to where it is installed.
