Installation instructions
=========================

Spyview stores its settings in your application data folder. If this folder does not exist, spyview will not be happy. 

So, first, you need to create this folder, and copy the default settings into it. 

You can do this by clicking on the "copy_def_settings.bat" script. 

Then, spyview should be happy.
